        1.	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Their intent in hiring our company, Global Rain, was to modernize their operations and increase the security on their custom software and web interface. Specifically, their software requirements included adding file verification to their web application, a data verification step in the form of checksums, and overall securing communications. 
        
        2.	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I feel that I very successfully tested potential vulnerabilities during static testing. It is important to code securely for many, likely obvious reasons, but the biggest of which is the protection of data and money, both your own and that of your client. Software security is the immune system of a company’s body, without it, the body would fall apart and crumble.
        
        3.	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was learning how to properly use the tools for testing. Learning how the dependency checking with Maven worked was actually instantly useful to me as well. It ended up being relevant and helping me in my other course for the semester. 

        4.	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I Increased the layers of security by utilizing fixes that already existed, which really brought to home how important it is to keep up to date with all components of system. In the future I would use Maven or another automated service to assess vulnerabilities due to their usefulness. I will likely use penetration testing sometime in the future.

        5.	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made certain that the code and software application were functional and secure by running debug tests and utilizing the tools provided by these third parties. After refactoring and before submitting I also ran additional tests to confirm that I didn’t inadvertently mess something up.


        6.	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The resources that I used that I found particularly helpful were the ones provided in the course, such as the OWASP dependency check, the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram, as well as several tutorial websites I found through google searches. 


        7.	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I am not really sure what I could show from this assignment that would justify my skills to future employers as I feel they would be looking for something more intensive and my own, whereas this course had mostly laid the groundwork for us. If I had to choose, I would say the refactored code from Project Two, as well as the basic checksum and dependency creation, as it would illustrate that I at least know how to do those.
